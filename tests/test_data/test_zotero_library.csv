In contrast to metal substrates, both the parallel and perpendicular vibrational components of the adsorbate can be detected on these dielectric surfaces. The monolayer reflection spectra show significant changes as a function of the light incidence angle and the polarization of the infrared radiation, which contain detailed information on the surface orientation of the film molecules. Spectral simulations based on classical electromagnetic theory yield an average 10 tilt angle of the hydrocarbon chains with respect to the surface normal on both silicon and glass surfaces. Despite this apparent structural identity of the monolayer films on silicon and glass, significant differences are observed in the monolayer reflection spectra resulting from purely optical effects of the substrate.",1-Feb-97,10/14/2013 22:50,10/14/2013 22:50,10/14/2013 22:50,209-217,,2,51,,Appl.

In the past, light has been used to alter the emission wavelength of individual molecules or modulate the energy transfer quantum yield between them. Furthermore, tensile stress has been applied to study the force dependence of protein folding/unfolding and of the chemistry and photochemistry of single molecules, although in these mechanical experiments the strength of the weakest bond limits the amount of applicable force. Here, we show that compressive stress modifies the photophysical properties of individual dye molecules. We use an atomic force microscope tip to prod individual molecules adsorbed on a surface and follow the effect of the applied force on the electronic states of the molecule by fluorescence spectroscopy. Applying a localized compressive force on an isolated molecule induces a stress that is redistributed throughout the structure. Accordingly, we observe reversible spectral shifts and even shifts that persist after retracting the microscope tip, which we attribute to transitions to metastable states. Using quantum-mechanical calculations, we show that these photophysical changes can be associated with transitions among the different possible conformers of the adsorbed molecule.",26-Jan-14,1/28/2014 20:03,1/28/2014 20:03,1/28/2014 20:03,,,,advance online publication,,Nat Nano,,,,,,,,en,© 2014 Nature Publishing Group,,,,www.nature.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been predicted that supersymmetry and Majorana fermions, both of which remain elusive in particle physics, may be realized through emergent particles in these particular superconducting systems. Using artificially fabricated topological-insulator–superconductor heterostructures, we present direct spectroscopic evidence for the existence of Cooper pairing in a weakly interacting half Dirac gas. Our studies reveal that two dimensional topological superconductivity in a helical Dirac gas is distinctly different from that in an ordinary two-dimensional superconductor in terms of the spin degrees of freedom of electrons. We further show that the pairing of Dirac electrons can be suppressed by time-reversal symmetry-breaking impurities, thereby removing the distinction.

We describe several procedures for extending the range of validity of the solution. Analysis of correlations shows that the uncertainty ?(?R/R) of ?R/R is significantly more important than the ?(??/?) of ??/?, which allows us to obtain an expression for the uncertainties ?n, ??, and ?d of n, ?, and d, and to identify conditions that optimize the determination of the layer parameters. We find that the relative uncertainties ?n/n and ?d/d are not equal, as would be expected if they were determined by the optical thickness nd measured by ellipsometry, but that ?R/R breaks the connection. We verify our results by measurements of H2O reversibly physisorbed on oxidized GaAs, finding, for example, that for our conditions ?? is determined more accurately than ?n, and ?n more accurately than ?d. These data and model calculations show that fluctuations in parameters, particularly d, are asymmetric, leading in principle to inaccurate average values. However, we show that the importance of the ?R/R data together with the remaining high correlation between n and d allows us to define a characteristic curve that can be used to correct the results for this nonlinearity. Finally, we extend our analysis to determine the orthogonal linear combinations of n, ?, and d that the data actually determine, which explains why the data fit the characteristic curve so well. Our results will be useful in various contexts for the analysis of films less than 1?nm thick, for example, in applications involving preparation of next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices with complicated multilayer structures, real-time control of deposition, and the identification of physisorbed and chemisorbed layers on the monolayer scale.",2/6/2007,1/31/2013 5:00,1/31/2013 5:00,1/31/2013 5:00,033109-033109-11,,3,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AIP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.",15-Nov-50,5/21/2012 23:56,5/21/2012 23:56,5/21/2012 23:56,580-594,,4,80,,Phys.

Micro-fabricated memory elements, processors, sensors, circuit elements, lasers, displays, detectors, etc are ubiquitous. However, the dawn of the 21st century has brought with it immense new challenges, and indeed opportunities—some of which require a paradigm shift in the way we think about resource use and disposal, which in turn directly impacts our ongoing relationship with inorganic semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide. Furthermore, advances in fields such as nano-medicine and bioelectronics, and the impending revolution of the ‘ubiquitous sensor network’, all require new functional materials which are bio-compatible, cheap, have minimal embedded manufacturing energy plus extremely low power consumption, and are mechanically robust and flexible for integration with tissues, building structures, fabrics and all manner of hosts. In this short review article we summarize current progress in creating materials with such properties. We focus primarily on organic and bio-organic electronic and optoelectronic systems derived from or inspired by nature, and outline the complex charge transport and photo-physics which control their behaviour. We also introduce the concept of electrical devices based upon ion or proton flow (‘ionics and protonics’) and focus particularly on their role as a signal interface with biological systems.

Relative to the widely studied 7,7?-[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b?]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]bis[6-fluoro-4-(5?-hexyl-[2,2?-bithiophene]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2), which contains the stronger donor fragment dithienosilole (DTS) as D2, one finds that p-SIDT(FBTTh2)2 exhibits a wider band gap and can be used to fabricate bulk heterojunction solar cells with higher open circuit voltage (0.91 V). Most remarkably, thin films comprising p-SIDT(FBTTh2)2 can achieve exceptional levels of self-organization directly via solution deposition. For example, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that p-SIDT(FBTTh2)2 spin-cast from chlorobenzene organizes into crystalline domains with lattice planes that extend over length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers. Such features suggest liquid crystalline properties during the evolution of the film. Moreover, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis shows a strong tendency for the molecules to exist with a strong ?face-on? orientation relative to the substrate plane. Similar structural features, albeit of more restricted dimensions, can be observed within p-SIDT(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM bulk heterojunction thin films when the films are processed with 0.4% diiodooctane (DIO) solvent additive. DIO use also increases the solar cell power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 1.7% to 6.4%. Of significance from a practical device fabrication perspective is that, for p-SIDT(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM blends, there is a wide range of compositions (from 20:80 to 70:30 p-SIDT(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM) that provide good photovoltaic response, i.e., PCE = 4?6%, indicating a robust tendency to form the necessary continuous phases for charge carrier collection. Light intensity photocurrent measurements, charge selective diode fabrication, and internal quantum efficiency determinations were carried out to obtain insight into the mechanism of device operation. Inclusion of DIO in the casting solution results in films that exhibit much lower photocurrent dependence on voltage and a concomitant increase in fill factor. At the optimum blend ratio, devices show high charge carrier mobilities, while mismatched hole and electron mobilities in blends with high or low donor content result in reduced fill factors and device performance.",5-Mar-14,10/30/2014 20:49,10/30/2014 20:49,10/30/2014 20:49,3597-3606,,9,136,,J.

In this way substantial changes of the amplitude, phase or polarization of light waves are gradually accumulated along the optical path. This Review focuses on recent developments on flat, ultrathin optical components dubbed 'metasurfaces' that produce abrupt changes over the scale of the free-space wavelength in the phase, amplitude and/or polarization of a light beam. Metasurfaces are generally created by assembling arrays of miniature, anisotropic light scatterers (that is, resonators such as optical antennas). The spacing between antennas and their dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength. As a result the metasurfaces, on account of Huygens principle, are able to mould optical wavefronts into arbitrary shapes with subwavelength resolution by introducing spatial variations in the optical response of the light scatterers. Such gradient metasurfaces go beyond the well-established technology of frequency selective surfaces made of periodic structures and are extending to new spectral regions the functionalities of conventional microwave and millimetre-wave transmit-arrays and reflect-arrays. Metasurfaces can also be created by using ultrathin films of materials with large optical losses. By using the controllable abrupt phase shifts associated with reflection or transmission of light waves at the interface between lossy materials, such metasurfaces operate like optically thin cavities that strongly modify the light spectrum. Technology opportunities in various spectral regions and their potential advantages in replacing existing optical components are discussed.",Feb-14,2/19/2014 20:30,2/19/2014 20:30,2/19/2014 20:30,139-150,,2,13,,Nat Mater,,,,,,,,en,"© 2014 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A giant?pulse ruby laser provides the primary source of radiation of 14 400 cm?1 (up to 1027 photons/cm2?sec) and is also used to generate second?harmonic radiation from ADP, as well as stimulated Raman radiation of 12 800 and 17 500 cm?1 from liquid oxygen. The time dependence of the fluorescence intensity is studied as a function of laser intensity, crystal temperature and excitation wavelength. The very intense fast fluorescence with a half?life of 30 nsec at 300°K, characteristic of singlet exciton decay, and the relatively weak delayed fluorescence which involves intermediate triplet states, are separated using sectored disks. It is concluded that the triplet state at 14 750 cm?1 can be populated (i) by direct absorption of laser photons involving an activation energy of 350 cm?1; (ii) via two?photon absorption, presumably leading to a vibrationally excited state of the 1B2u exciton, followed by intersystem crossing; (iii) via one?photon (second?harmonic) excitation from levels?700 cm?1 into the singlet absorption band, followed by conversion of the singlet exciton into a triplet pair. The latter process is suggested by the observed activation energy of 700 cm?1. In agreement with these interpretations, the delayed fluorescence intensity is found to vary with the second to fourth power of the laser intensity depending on the experimental conditions. Also, light of 17 500 cm?1 leads exclusively to Process (i), light of 12 800 cm?1 exclusively to (ii). Triplet lifetimes from 2–17 msec are obtained, depending on crystal purity, which indicates that unimolecular triplet decay is an extrinsic, radiationless process. A singlet—triplet intersystem crossing rate constant of about 3×10?5 sec?1 is estimated. The triplet—triplet annihilation rate constant is found to be about 5×10?11 cm3 sec?1.

The simplicity of using only two numbers, ‘0’ and ‘1’, in a binary system for describing an arbitrary quantity made the fields of digital electronics and digital signal processing powerful and ubiquitous. Here, inspired by the binary concept, we propose to develop the notion of digital metamaterials. Specifically, we investigate how one can synthesize an electromagnetic metamaterial with a desired permittivity, using as building blocks only two elemental materials, which we call ‘metamaterial bits’, with two distinct permittivity functions. We demonstrate, analytically and numerically, how proper spatial mixtures of such metamaterial bits lead to elemental ‘metamaterial bytes’ with effective material parameters that are different from the parameters of the metamaterial bits.

In crystalline semiconductor microcavities, bosonic quasiparticles, known as exciton–polaritons, can be created through strong coupling between bound electron–hole pairs and the photon field. Recently, a non-equilibrium BEC (ref. 3) and superfluidity have been demonstrated in such structures. With organic crystals grown inside dielectric microcavities, signatures of polariton lasing have been observed. However, owing to the deleterious effects of disorder and material imperfection on the condensed phase, only crystalline materials of the highest quality have been used until now. Here we demonstrate non-equilibrium BEC of exciton–polaritons in a polymer-filled microcavity at room temperature. We observe thermalization of polaritons and, above a critical excitation density, clear evidence of condensation at zero in-plane momentum, namely nonlinear behaviour, blueshifted emission and long-range coherence. The key signatures distinguishing the behaviour from conventional photon lasing are presented.

Here, localization due to charge relaxation is investigated in a prototypal system, a good electron transporting naphthalenediimide based copolymer, by means of current-voltage I-V electrical characteristics and charge modulation spectroscopy (CMS) in top-gate field-effect transistors (FETs), combined with density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. In particular, pristine copolymer films are compared with films that underwent a melt-annealing process, the latter leading to a drastic change of the microstructure. Despite the packing modification, which involves also the channel region, both the electron mobility and the energy of polaronic transitions are substantially unchanged upon melt-annealing. The polaron absorption features can be rationalized and reproduced by TDDFT calculations for isolated charged oligomers. Therefore, it is concluded that in such a high electron mobility copolymer the charge transport process involves polaronic species which are intramolecular in nature and, from a more general point of view, that interchain delocalization of the polaron is not necessary to sustain charge mobilities in the 0.1 to 1 cm2 V– 1 s–1 range. These findings contribute to the rationalization of the charge transport process in the recently developed class of donor-acceptor ?-conjugated copolymers featuring high charge mobilities and complex morphologies.",1-Jul-14,7/28/2014 21:09,7/28/2014 21:09,7/28/2014 21:09,n/a-n/a,,,,,Adv.

Furthermore, studies on CVD diamond grown on (110)-oriented substrates show a near 100% preferential orientation of NV centers along only the [111] and [1? 1? 1] directions, rather than the four possible orientations.

Both internal and external reflection experiments as well as transmission can be handled. The theory is valid for all wavelengths and is appropriate, therefore, for such experiments as x?ray reflectivity, uv–visible spectroscopic ellipsometry, and infrared reflection spectroscopy. Further, the theory is applicable to multilayered filmstructures of variable number of layers, each with any degree of anisotropy up to and including full biaxial symmetry. The reflectivities (and transmissivities) are obtained at each frequency by solving the wave propagation equations using a rigorous 4×4 transfer matrix method developed by Yeh in which the optical functions of each medium are described in the form of second rank (3×3) tensors. In order to obtain optical tensors for materials not readily available in single crystal form, a method has been developed to evaluate tensor elements from the complex scalar optical functions (n?) obtained from the isotropic material with the limitations that the molecular excitations are well characterized and obey photon–dipole selection rules. This method is intended primarily for infrared vibrational spectroscopy and involves quantitative decomposition of the isotropic imaginary optical function (k) spectrum into a sum of contributions from fundamental modes, the assignment of a direction in molecular coordinates to the transition dipole matrix elements for each mode, the appropriate scaling of each k vector component in surface coordinates according to a selected surface orientation of the molecule to give a diagonal im(n?) tensor, and the calculation of the real(n?) spectrumtensor elements by the Kramers–Kronig transformation. Tensors for other surface orientations are generated by an appropriate rotation matrix operation. To test the viability of this approach, three sets of experimentally derived infrared spectra of oriented monolayer assemblies on quite distinctively different substrates were chosen for simulation: (1) n?alkanethiols self? assembled onto gold, (2) n?alkanoic acid salt Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) monolayers on carbon, and (3) n?alkanoic acid salt LB monolayers on silica glass. The formalism developed was used to simulate the spectral response and to derive structural features of the monolayers. Good agreement was found where comparisons with independent studies could be made and, in general, the method appears quite useful for structural studies of highly organized thin films.",1/15/1992,4/14/2014 20:58,4/14/2014 20:58,4/14/2014 20:58,927-945,,2,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,scitation.aip.org,,,Infrared spectra; Monolayers; Reflectivity; Tensor methods; Thin film structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the oligomers, this feature grows quadratically with respect to the first PA feature, as a result of nonlinear interactions of the primary excitons.

The field dependence consists of an increase at low fields, with a maximum at ca. 350 Oe, followed by a decrease at higher fields to less than the zero-field annihilation rate. For most field directions, a second maximum occurs at ca. 600 Oe. The amplitude of the field dependence is highly anisotropic. For fields >2000 Oe, resonances in the annihilation rate are found at +76° and -17° with respect to the a axis for fields in the ac plane and at ±23.5° with respect to the b axis in the ab plane. For fields <500 Oe, a second set of resonances occurs at directions bisecting the high-field resonances and at intermediate fields the two sets coexist. These results are discussed in terms of a density-matrix description of the spin states of the interacting triplet pair and of the annihilation process. The field dependence is accounted for on the basis of the field dependence of the pair spin states together with the postulate that annihilation is spin-allowed. The observed resonances result from level crossings among the pair spin states. All of the structure in the field dependence and anisotropy data is satisfactorily reproduced by calculations based on the model, although complete quantitative agreement is not achieved.",15-Jan-70,12/11/2012 17:52,12/11/2012 17:52,12/11/2012 17:52,896-902,,2,1,,Phys.

Non-annealed blend compositions with 0–80 wt % fullerene content were analyzed using temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) and room temperature spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements. To evaluate the SE data with respect to the optical order, an optical model was developed, including a lower and higher ordered polymer phase within a fullerene matrix. This was done using an effective medium approach describing the polymer by combining lower and higher ordered polymer properties (polymer-EMA). The polymer/fullerene blend was then evaluated using another EMA consisting of the polymer-EMA and the dielectric function of the disordered fullerene. The degree of optical order obtained by SE, was confirmed using another independent measurement, photoluminescence spectroscopy, according to the method of Francis C. Spano (2005). The volume fraction of the ordered polymer within the polymer-EMA was found to be between 70 and 60 vol % for fullerene contents lower than 20 wt % in the polymer/fullerene blend. Above 20 wt % fullerene, the optical order of the polymer strongly decreases all the way down to 0 vol %. In contrast to the complementary performed X-ray diffraction measurements, which address only the long-range structural order of the blends, we give quantitative information on the optical order, including information on the composition, that is, volume fractions of the higher and lower ordered polymer. The gained information on the tilt of the polymer molecules with respect to the substrate is discussed comparing XRD results from the literature with those obtained by our SE model. Finally, the developed model is used to describe the influence of the P3HT molecular weight on the optical order.

The results are in accord with recent work of Bounds and Siebrand suggesting that CT excitons are generated by direct transitions rather than by autoionization of a localized excited molecular state followed by thermalization. The influence of the external field on the singlet exciton transition is explained in terms of a quadratic Stark effect.",1-Oct-81,11/28/2012 5:48,11/28/2012 5:48,11/28/2012 5:48,125-135,,1–2,61,,Chemical Physics,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But two concerns must be satisfied before it can be exploited in low-cost solution-processed organic solar cells. Fission must be combined with longer wavelength absorption in a structure that can potentially surpass the single junction limit, and its efficiency must be demonstrated in nanoscale domains within blended devices. Here, we report organic solar cells comprised of tetracene, copper phthalocyanine, and the buckyball C60. Short wavelength light generates singlet excitons in tetracene. These are subsequently split into two triplet excitons and transported through the phthalocyanine. In addition, the phthalocyanine absorbs photons below the singlet exciton energy of tetracene. To test tetracene in nanostructured blends, we fabricate coevaporated bulk heterojunctions and multilayer heterojunctions of tetracene and C60.

Zinc(II) 5,15-di(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin (Z1), its directly meso,meso-linked porphyrin dimer (Z2), trimer (Z3), and tetramer (Z4) were synthesized with the goal to elucidate the relationship between exciton migration and structural change upon photoexcitation. One of the most important factors in structural changes for these porphyrin arrays is mainly determined by the dihedral angle between adjacent porphyrin moieties. For a systematic approach toward the investigation of the exciton coupling dynamics influenced by the relative orientation between neighboring porphyrin molecules, various time-resolved spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence decay and transient absorption measurements with different polarization in pump/probe beams have been utilized. The steady-state excitation anisotropy spectra of Z2, Z3, and Z4 porphyrin arrays show that the photoexcitation of the high-energy exciton Soret band induces a large angle change between absorption and emission dipoles in contrast with the photoexcitation of the low-energy exciton split Soret and Q-bands. In the order of Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4, their S1 states decay faster because of the increasing energy dissipation processes into a larger number of accessible states. In contrast, the rotational diffusion rates become slower in the same order because the overall molecular shape is elongated along the long axis of the molecular arrays, which experiences a large displacement of solvent molecules in rotational diffusion motion. Ultrafast fluorescence decay measurements show that the S2 ? S1 internal conversion process occurs in less than 1 ps in Z2, Z3, and Z4 due to the existence of exciton split band as a ladder-type deactivation channel, while this process is relatively slow in Z1 (?1.6 ps). Femtosecond transient absorption experiments with magic angle and different polarization in probe beam were performed to find the relationship between energy relaxation and anisotropy dynamics upon photoexcitation. The internal conversion in Z2, Z3, and Z4 is likely to be accompanied by the incoherent energy hopping processes occurring in less than ?200 fs judging from a large change in the anisotropy value in the transient absorption decay. In addition, the decay components with approximately 8 ps time constant were observed in both fluorescence up-conversion and femtosecond transient absorption decays. These components are believed to arise from the conformational change in the excited states, because the dihedral angle distribution in these arrays was estimated to be 90° ± 20° at ambient temperature from the AM1 calculation.",1-Apr-00,10/8/2013 21:38,10/8/2013 21:38,10/8/2013 21:38,3287-3298,,15,104,,J.

Detailed fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopy was performed on P3HT solid-state films and on P3HT in chlorobenzene solution. Two excitation wavelengths and several emission wavelengths, covering the entire fluorescence spectrum, were used. The data were complemented by polarization-sensitive measurements. Our global analysis allowed a reconstruction of the time-resolved emission spectra with 200 fs temporal resolution, so that spectral changes due to the early relaxation processes following ???* interband absorption in the pristine polymer could be comprehensively characterized. Absorption occurs in isolated polymer chains in solution and in the solid state (including interchain interactions) for the film. In both cases, we find evidence of delocalization of the electrons and holes formed in the energy bands directly after photoexcitation with excess energy. This is followed by ultrafast (?100 fs) self-localization of the primary photoexcitation and by relatively slow exciton formation (?1 ps). Further relaxation occurs with time constants ranging from hundreds of femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds, due to exciton hopping to sites with lower energy and to a slow conformational planarization of the polymer backbone. Depolarization, a spectral red shift, and important changes in the vibronic structure are observed as a consequence of this relaxation. Finally, relaxed intrachain and interchain singlet excitons are formed in solution and film, respectively, on a 100?200 ps time scale. They decay with a ?500 ps time constant, by intersystem crossing in solution and by nonradiative recombination in the film. Our results are consistent with and strongly support the conclusions we obtained from a similar time-resolved fluorescence study of the polymer PCDTBT (J. Am. Chem.

Polarized transmittance, reflectance, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra have been measured over a broad spectral range, at different temperatures. Due to the high degree of chain orientation in the polymer films, the emission properties are highly anisotropic. The PL spectral shape and external quantum efficiency are significantly affected by self-absorption inside the polymer film and by refractive effects at the polymer-air interface. In order to elucidate these aspects we have determined the dispersion of the parallel and perpendicular components of the complex dielectric constant (?1+i?2), by which the PL spectra have been corrected according to Fresnel equations. After correction, the PL intensity is found to be higher when the excitation is polarized perpendicular to the stretching direction, a fact that we attribute to charge-induced PL quenching. We have also considered the influence of the refractive index on the PL spontaneous emission rate and on the light extraction from the polymer film. The spectral dependence of the emission anisotropy functions of the corrected PL spectra indicates the presence of two distinct emitting species, which may originate from intramolecular and intermolecular states.",13-Feb-07,10/29/2013 23:05,10/29/2013 23:05,10/29/2013 23:05,75204,,7,75,,Phys.

DA combinations with a small difference between the energy of the CT state (ECT) and energy of the donor exciton (ED*) are of special interest since energy losses due to electron transfer are minimized, resulting in an optimized open-circuit voltage. In that case, the CT state can be considered as a resonance mixture, containing character of a fully ionic state (D+A?) and of the local polymer excited state (D*A). We show that the D*A contribution to the overall CT state wave function can be determined by measurements of the polarization anisotropy of CT absorption and emission of polymer:fullerene blends with aligned polymer chains. We study two donor polymers, P3HT and TQ1, blended with fullerene acceptors with different ionization potentials, allowing variation of the ED*?ECT difference. We find that, upon decreasing ED*?ECT, the local excitonic D*A character of the CT state increases, resulting in a decreased fraction of charge transferred and an increased transition dipole moment. For typical polymer:fullerene systems, this effect is expected to become detrimental for device performance if ED*?ECT<0.1 eV.

Even at this initial stage of laboratory production, the energy payback time and CO2 emission factor for the organic photovoltaic technology is of the same order of other inorganic photovoltaic technologies, demonstrating that there is plenty of room for improvement if the fabrication procedure is optimized and scaled up to an industrial process.

The primary charge-generation mechanism involves a light-induced ultrafast electron transfer from the light-absorbing and electron-donating polymer to the fullerene electron acceptor. Here, we elucidate the initial quantum dynamics of this process. Experimentally, we observed coherent vibrational motion of the fullerene moiety after impulsive optical excitation of the polymer donor. Comparison with first-principle theoretical simulations evidences coherent electron transfer between donor and acceptor and oscillations of the transferred charge with a 25-femtosecond period matching that of the observed vibrational modes. Our results show that coherent vibronic coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom is of key importance in triggering charge delocalization and transfer in a noncovalently bound reference system. Pull, pull, pulling electrons along Organic photovoltaics operate by transferring charge from a light-absorbing donor material to a nearby acceptor. Falke et al. show that molecular vibrations smooth the way for this charge transfer to proceed. A combination of ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical simulations revealed an oscillatory signal in a model donor/acceptor blend that implicates carbon-carbon bond stretching in concert with the electronic transition. This vibrational/electronic, or vibronic, process maintains a quantum-mechanical phase relationship that guides the charge more rapidly and directly than an incoherent migration from donor to acceptor.

The ability to control various degrees of freedom of the excitation pulses?such as duration, sequence, frequency, polarization, and shape?has led to a variety of time-resolved spectroscopic methods. The various techniques that researchers use are commonly classified by their dimensionality, which refers to the number of independently variable time delays between the pulsed fields that induce the signal. Though pico- and femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopies of electronic transitions have come of age, only recently have researchers been able to perform two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES) in the visible frequency regime and correlate transition frequencies that evolve in different time intervals. The two-dimensional correlation plots and their temporal evolution allow one to access spectral information that is not exposed directly in other one-dimensional nonlinear methods. In this Account, we summarize our studies of a series of increasingly complex molecular chromophores. We examine noninteracting dye molecules, a monomer?dimer equilibrium of a prototypical dye molecule, and finally a supramolecular assembly of electronically coupled absorbers. By tracing vibronic signal modulations, differentiating line-broadening mechanisms, analyzing distinctly different relaxation dynamics, determining electronic coupling strengths, and directly following excitation energy transfer pathways, we illustrate how two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can image physical phenomena that underlie the optical response of a particular system. Although 2D-ES is far from being a ?turn-key? method, we expect that experimental progress and potential commercialization of instrumentation will make 2D-ES accessible to a much broader scientific audience, analogous to the development of multidimensional NMR and 2D-IR.",15-Sep-09,11/29/2012 21:34,11/29/2012 21:34,11/29/2012 21:34,1364-1374,,9,42,,Acc.

Photovoltaic power generation is intermittent and typically only exploits a portion of the solar spectrum efficiently, whereas the intrinsic irreversibilities of small heat engines make the solar–thermal approach best suited for utility-scale power plants. There is, therefore, an increasing need for hybrid technologies for solar power generation. By converting sunlight into thermal emission tuned to energies directly above the photovoltaic bandgap using a hot absorber–emitter, solar thermophotovoltaics promise to leverage the benefits of both approaches: high efficiency, by harnessing the entire solar spectrum; scalability and compactness, because of their solid-state nature; and dispatchablility, owing to the ability to store energy using thermal or chemical means. However, efficient collection of sunlight in the absorber and spectral control in the emitter are particularly challenging at high operating temperatures. This drawback has limited previous experimental demonstrations of this approach to conversion efficiencies around or below 1% (refs 9, 10, 11). Here, we report on a full solar thermophotovoltaic device, which, thanks to the nanophotonic properties of the absorber–emitter surface, reaches experimental efficiencies of 3.2%. The device integrates a multiwalled carbon nanotube absorber and a one-dimensional Si/SiO2 photonic-crystal emitter on the same substrate, with the absorber–emitter areas optimized to tune the energy balance of the device. Our device is planar and compact and could become a viable option for high-performance solar thermophotovoltaic energy conversion.",Feb-14,2/7/2014 22:58,2/7/2014 22:58,2/7/2014 22:58,126-130,,2,9,,Nat Nano,,,,,,,,en,© 2014 Nature Publishing Group,,,,www.nature.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has important consequences for electrical properties of these materials: charge transport is usually limited by the most difficult hopping processes and is therefore dominated by the disordered matrix, resulting in low charge-carrier mobilities (10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1). Here we use thin-film, field-effect transistor structures to probe the transport properties of the ordered microcrystalline domains in the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT. Self-organization in P3HT results in a lamella structure with two-dimensional conjugated sheets formed by interchain stacking. We find that, depending on processing conditions, the lamellae can adopt two different orientations—parallel and normal to the substrate—the mobilities of which differ by more than a factor of 100, and can reach values as high as 0.1 cm2 V-1 s-1 (refs 3, 4). Optical spectroscopy of the field-induced charge, combined with the mobility anisotropy, reveals the two-dimensional interchain character of the polaronic charge carriers, which exhibit lower relaxation energies than the corresponding radical cations on isolated one-dimensional chains.

We demonstrate a visible light–triggered quantitative topochemical polymerization reaction based on a conjugated dye molecule. Macroscopic-size, high-quality polymer single crystals are obtained. Polymerization is not limited to single crystals, but can also be achieved in highly concentrated solution or semicrystalline thin films. In addition, we show that the polymer decomposes to monomer upon thermolysis, which indicates that the polymerization-depolymerization process is reversible. The physical properties of the polymer crystals enable us to isolate single-polymer strands via mechanical exfoliation, which makes it possible to study individual, long polymer chains. Topochemical Polymerization In a topochemical reaction, chemical changes start at active sites in the solid and then proceed autocatalytically to neighboring regions. If one starts with a monomer that can form ordered structures similar to the final polymer, it is possible to polymerize chains in a fully ordered state and thus make very long single chains.

Such materials are used as active components in light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, or photovoltaic cells, as a substitute for (mostly Si-based) inorganic semiconducting materials. Many strategies developed for inorganic semiconductor device building (doping, p?n junctions, etc.) have been attempted, often successfully, with organics, even though the key electronic and photophysical properties of organic thin films are fundamentally different from those of their bulk inorganic counterparts. In particular, organic materials consist of individual units (molecules or conjugated segments) that are coupled by weak intermolecular forces. The flexibility of organic synthesis has allowed the development of more efficient opto-electronic devices including impressive improvements in quantum yields for charge generation in organic solar cells and in light emission in electroluminescent displays. Nonetheless, a number of fundamental questions regarding the working principles of these devices remain that preclude their full optimization. For example, the role of intermolecular interactions in driving the geometric and electronic structures of solid-state conjugated materials, though ubiquitous in organic electronic devices, has long been overlooked, especially when it comes to these interfaces with other (in)organic materials or metals. Because they are soft and in most cases disordered, conjugated organic materials support localized electrons or holes associated with local geometric distortions, also known as polarons, as primary charge carriers. The spatial localization of excess charges in organics together with low dielectric constant (?) entails very large electrostatic effects. It is therefore not obvious how these strongly interacting electron?hole pairs can potentially escape from their Coulomb well, a process that is at the heart of photoconversion or molecular doping. Yet they do, with near-quantitative yield in some cases. Limited screening by the low dielectric medium in organic materials leads to subtle static and dynamic electronic polarization effects that strongly impact the energy landscape for charges, which offers a rationale for this apparent inconsistency. In this Account, we use different theoretical approaches to predict the energy landscape of charge carriers at the molecular level and review a few case studies highlighting the role of electrostatic interactions in conjugated organic molecules. We describe the pros and cons of different theoretical approaches that provide access to the energy landscape defining the motion of charge carriers. We illustrate the applications of these approaches through selected examples involving OFETs, OLEDs, and solar cells. The three selected examples collectively show that energetic disorder governs device performances and highlights the relevance of theoretical tools to probe energy landscapes in molecular assemblies.",19-Feb-13,8/1/2013 23:28,8/1/2013 23:28,8/1/2013 23:28,434-443,,2,46,,Acc.

Directional optical properties can be exploited to enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices, optomechanical actuators and metamaterials. In layered materials, optical anisotropies may result from in-plane and out-of-plane dipoles associated with intra- and interlayer excitations, respectively. Here, we resolve the orientation of luminescent excitons and isolate photoluminescence signatures arising from distinct intra- and interlayer optical transitions. Combining analytical calculations with energy- and momentum-resolved spectroscopy, we distinguish between in-plane and out-of-plane oriented excitons in materials with weak or strong interlayer coupling—MoS2 and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), respectively. We demonstrate that photoluminescence from MoS2 mono-, bi- and trilayers originates solely from in-plane excitons, whereas PTCDA supports distinct in-plane and out-of-plane exciton species with different spectra, dipole strengths and temporal dynamics.

Despite the growing importance of this system, spectroscopic identification of different polymorphs for CuPc has posed difficulties. This study presents the first example of spectroscopic distinction of ?- and ?-forms of CuPc, the most widely used polymorphs, by solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and Raman spectroscopy. 13C high-resolution SSNMR spectra of ?- and ?-CuPc using very-fast magic angle spinning (VFMAS) at 20 kHz show that hyperfine shifts sensitively reflect polymorphs of CuPc. The experimental results were confirmed by ab initio chemical shift calculations. 13C and 1H SSNMR relaxation times of ?- and ?-CuPc under VFMAS also showed marked differences, presumably because of the difference in electronic spin correlation times in the two forms.

In thin films, the polymer chains tend to adopt an orientation parallel to the substrate; therefore, forcing the chains to stand perpendicular to the substrate is challenging. We have developed a simple way to achieve this end-on orientation. We functionalized one end of a poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT) chain with a 1H,1H,2H,2H,3H,3H-perfluoroundecyl group, which caused spontaneous self-segregation of the polymer (P3BT-F17) to the surface of the polymer film. In P3BT-F17/polystyrene (PS) blend films, a highly ordered end-on orientation of the conjugated backbone was observed in the surface-segregated layer of the crystalline P3BT-F17. Furthermore, when the film was spin-coated from a mixture of P3BT-F17 and P3BT, the chain orientation of P3BT-F17 at the surface forced the P3BT in the bulk of the film to adopt the end-on orientation because of the high crystallinity of P3BT. The electronic conductivity measured perpendicular to the film surface also reflected the end-on orientation in the bulk, resulting in a more than 30-fold enhancement of the hole mobility.",3-Jul-13,10/15/2013 18:27,10/15/2013 18:27,10/15/2013 18:27,9644-9647,,26,135,,J.

From a theoretical perspective, a quantitative answer to this question consists of three components: energetic alignment, electronic coupling, and dynamic localization due to polarization in nuclear coordinates. These three concepts are not unique to molecular electronics but have long been at the center of chemisorption studies.

We provide theory as well as an experimental realization with an all–visible spectrum, p-polarized angularly selective material system. Our method enables transparency throughout the visible spectrum at one angle—the generalized Brewster angle—and reflection at every other viewing angle.

While the selection of light signals based on the first two properties has been studied in depth, selection based on direction is relatively unexplored but equally important. Shen et al.

In contrast, the photogenerated excitons in organic photovoltaic cells are dissociated at a single donor–acceptor heterojunction formed within a de-mixed blend of the donor and acceptor semiconductors. The nanoscale morphology and high charge densities give a high rate of electron–hole encounters, which should in principle result in the formation of spin-triplet excitons, as in organic light-emitting diodes. Although organic photovoltaic cells would have poor quantum efficiencies if every encounter led to recombination, state-of-the-art examples nevertheless demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency. Here we show that this suppression of recombination arises through the interplay between spin, energetics and delocalization of electronic excitations in organic semiconductors. We use time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of model high-efficiency polymer–fullerene systems in which the lowest-energy molecular triplet exciton (T1) for the polymer is lower in energy than the intermolecular charge transfer state. We observe the formation of T1 states following bimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes generate charge transfer states with both spin-singlet (1CT) and spin-triplet (3CT) characters. We show that the formation of triplet excitons can be the main loss mechanism in organic photovoltaic cells. But we also find that, even when energetically favoured, the relaxation of 3CT states to T1 states can be strongly suppressed by wavefunction delocalization, allowing for the dissociation of 3CT states back to free charges, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance. Our results point towards new design rules both for photoconversion systems, enabling the suppression of electron–hole recombination, and for organic light-emitting diodes, avoiding the formation of triplet excitons and enhancing fluorescence efficiency.",22-Aug-13,9/25/2013 23:12,9/25/2013 23:12,9/25/2013 23:12,435-439,,7463,500,,Nature,,,,,,,,en,"© 2013 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The spatial and spin motion of the excitons, as well as the annihilation process itself, is treated phenomenologically. Exciton propagation is assumed to take place as in the hopping model. The importance of the dimensionality of the exciton motion is pointed out; in nearly one- or two-dimensional cases, certain lifetime processes control the exciton collision rate, in contrast to the three-dimensional case. These lifetime processes include motion out of the one- or two-dimensional subspace and, for excitons with spin, spin relaxation. The theory leads to a description of magnetic field effects on the annihilation rate of triplet excitons at room temperature. When applied to triplet excitons in anthracene, this description gives a satsfactory fit to the observed effects and leads to the determination of the nearest-neighbor exciton annihilation rate, the singlet-channel annihilation rate constant, and the exciton diffusion constant for motion perpendicular to the ab plane of anthracene.",15-Feb-70,12/9/2012 0:47,12/9/2012 0:47,12/9/2012 0:47,1716-1739,,4,1,,Phys.

This not only limits the rational design of materials with higher performance, but also prevents the study of physical phenomena associated with an extended ?-electron delocalization along the polymer backbone. Here we report a comparative transport study of several high-mobility conjugated polymers by field-effect-modulated Seebeck, transistor and sub-bandgap optical absorption measurements.

The literature in this area is vast: more than 3000 papers have been published in on P3HT (and related materials) and applications to organic solar energy harvesting devices over the last 20 years. Thus, no single review can capture the breadth and depth of this research.

This mini-review is organized as follows: First, a summary of the theoretical framework commonly used to describe fundamental physical processes of charge generation in organic (polymeric) semiconductor materials is presented.

Such excitations, or excitons, are generally spread out over several molecules: a balance between the delocalizing influence of resonant intermolecular coupling and the localizing influence of static and dynamic disorder determines the coherence range of the exciton. Because of the ?soft? nature of organic materials, significant nuclear relaxation in the participating molecules also accompanies the electronic excitations. To properly understand energy or charge transport, one must treat intermolecular (excitonic) coupling, electron-vibrational coupling, and disorder on equal footing. In this Account, we review the key elements of a theoretical approach based on a multiparticle representation that describes electronic excitations in organic materials as vibronic excitations surrounded by a field of vibrational excitations. Such composite excitations are appropriately called Frenkel excitonic polarons. For many conjugated molecules, the bulk of the nuclear reorganization energy following electronic excitation arises from the elongation of a symmetric vinyl stretching mode with energy ?1400 cm?1. To appreciate the impact of aggregation, we study how the vibronic progression of this mode, which dominates the isolated (solvated) molecule absorption and emission spectra, is distorted when molecules are close enough to interact with each other. As we demonstrate in this Account, the nature of the distortion provides a wealth of information about how the molecules are packed, the strength of the excitonic interactions between molecules, the number of molecules that are coherently coupled, and the nature of the disorder. We show that the aggregation-induced deviations from the Poissonian distribution of vibronic peak intensities take on two extremes identified with ideal H- and J-aggregates. The sign of the nearest neighbor electronic coupling, positive for H and negative for J, distinguishes the two basic aggregate forms. For several decades, researchers have known that H-aggregates exhibit blue-shifted absorption spectra and are subradiant while J-aggregates exhibit the opposite behavior (red-shifted absorption and superradiance). However, the exact inclusion of exciton?vibrational coupling reveals several more distinguishing traits between the two aggregate types: in H(J)-aggregates the ratio of the first two vibronic peak intensities in the absorption spectrum decreases (increases) with increasing excitonic coupling, while the ratio of the 0?0 to 0?1 emission intensities increases (decreases) with disorder and increases (decreases) with increasing temperature. These two extreme behaviors provide the framework for understanding absorption and emission in more complex morphologies, such as herringbone packing in oligo(phenylene vinylene)s, oligothiophenes and polyacene crystals, as well as the polymorphic packing arrangements observed in carotenoids.",16-Mar-10,10/17/2013 19:37,10/17/2013 19:37,10/17/2013 19:37,429-439,,3,43,,Acc.

While microstructural investigations, such as those based on X-rays, electron microscopy, or polarized optical probes, provide necessary information for the rationalization of transport in macromolecular solids, a general model predicting how charge accommodates within structural maps is not yet available. Therefore, techniques capable of directly monitoring how charge is distributed when injected into a polymer film and how it correlates to structural domains can help fill this gap. Supported by density functional theory calculations, here we show that polarized charge modulation microscopy (p-CMM) can unambiguously and selectively map the orientational order of the only conjugated segments that are probed by mobile charge in the few nanometer thick accumulation layer of a high-mobility polymer-based field-effect transistor . Depending on the specific solvent-induced microstructure within the accumulation layer, we show that p-CMM can image charge-probed domains that extend from submicrometer to tens of micrometers size, with markedly different degrees of alignment. Wider and more ordered p-CMM domains are associated with improved carrier mobility, as extracted from device characteristics. This observation evidences the unprecedented opportunity to correlate, directly in a working device, electronic properties with structural information on those conjugated segments involved in charge transport at the buried semiconductor?dielectric interface of a field-effect device.",24-Jun-14,7/28/2014 21:13,7/28/2014 21:13,7/28/2014 21:13,5968-5978,,6,8,,ACS Nano,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACS Publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organic field-effect transistors, in which the active semiconducting layer is an organic material, allow the simple fabrication of ultrathin, compact devices. Here we demonstrate a circularly polarized light-detecting organic field-effect transistor based on an asymmetrically pure, helically shaped chiral semiconducting molecule known as a helicene.

The use of the donor polymer PTB7 instead of poly(3-hexylthiophene) results in a higher open-circuit voltage and an overall spectral response better matched to the solar spectrum. A power conversion efficiency of 1.1% is reported with a peak external quantum efficiency of 18% at a wavelength of 680 nm. The microstructure of PTB7:P(NDI2OD-T2) blends is also investigated using a combination of grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), near-edge X-ray fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM).

STXM measurements indicate a lack of mesoscale phase separation, with AFM and NEXAFS measurements revealing a P(NDI2OD-T2)-rich top surface with fibrillar morphology.

An idle qubit can be efficiently insulated from the outside world via dynamical decoupling, as has recently been demonstrated for individual solid-state qubits. However, protection of qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate poses a non-trivial problem: in general the decoupling disrupts the inter-qubit dynamics, and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly salient for hybrid systems, wherein different types of qubits evolve and decohere at vastly different rates. Here we present the integration of dynamical decoupling into quantum gates for a paradigmatic hybrid system, the electron-nuclear spin register. Our design harnesses the internal resonance in the coupled-spin system to resolve the conflict between gate operation and decoupling. We experimentally demonstrate these gates on a two-qubit register in diamond operating at room temperature. Quantum tomography reveals that the qubits involved in the gate operation are protected as accurately as idle qubits. We further illustrate the power of our design by executing Grover's quantum search algorithm, achieving fidelities above 90% even though the execution time exceeds the electron spin dephasing time by two orders of magnitude.

Here we review progress in improving charge extraction, achieved by engineering the composition and structure of the electrode materials that contact the colloidal quantum dot film. New classes of structured electrodes have been developed and integrated to form bulk heterojunction devices that enhance photocharge extraction. Control over band offsets, doping and interfacial trap state densities have been essential for achieving improved electrical communication with colloidal quantum dot solids.

Here we focus on a well-known model material for electron transport, a naphthalene-diimide based copolymer, and we demonstrate that mobility can be controlled over two orders of magnitude, with maximum saturation mobility exceeding 1 cm2/Vs at high gate voltages, by controlling the extent of orientational domains through a deposition process as simple as spin-coating.

First, the polymer chain can undergo local reorganisation of the pi -electron bonding in the vicinity of a charge added to it. This has the effect of localising the charge in a state that can be described as a soliton for the particular case of trans-polyacetylene, and more generally as a polaron. Secondly, the motion of charged excitations is highly anisotropic, with strong confinement to the chain through the 'polaronic' structural relaxation of the chain. This anisotropy strongly affects charge transport and charge separation following photo-excitation. The authors review some of the recent work in this area and present polarisation-dependent measurements of photoluminescence (PL) and photo-induced absorption (PA) on highly oriented films of polyacetylene and poly(phenylenevinylene). They find that charge separation, detected through PA from photogenerated solitons or bipolarons, is the result of inter-chain electron transfer, whereas intra-chain excitation leads to charge confinement, and decay by PL (for poly(phenylenevinylene)) and by non-radiative channels. They find furthermore that these non-radiative channels become more efficient as the length of the conjugated polymer chain increases, and consider that this occurs through rapid motion of the excited state to recombination centres. They have identified both monomolecular and bimolecular kinetics for these processes.",11/14/1987,4/14/2014 20:53,4/14/2014 20:53,4/14/2014 20:53,1367,,11,20,,J. Phys. D: Appl.

Our finding shows that optical control of magnetic materials is a much more general phenomenon than previously assumed and may have a major impact on data memory and storage industries through the integration of optical control of ferromagnetic bits. All-optical magnetic state switching Magneto-optical memory storage media, such as hard drives, use magnetic fields to change the magnetization of memory bits, but the process is slow. Light can often reveal information about the magnetization state of a sample, such as its field direction.

No significant spectral shifts are recorded when passing from very diluted solutions to the solid state, while clear variations in the relative intensity of specific spectral markers are observed. The comparison of the spectral patterns shown by IR spectra recorded with reflection?absorption IR spectroscopy (RAIRS) and in normal transmission experiments allows to derive a structural model of the polymer. In as-cast films, or in films subjected to mild thermal treatments, below the melting point, the backbone of the polymer chains lies preferentially in the substrate plane, with the T2 units lying flat parallel to the substrate and the NDI2OD unit featuring a dihedral angle ? with the T2 unit (? ? 38°). This structure and polymer orientation is consistent with reported good bulk electron mobility in vertical diodes structures and high field-effect mobility in lateral field-effect transistors.

Examples of how these methods have been applied to study structural ordering in semicrystalline polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) are presented. The electronic structure of these materials is important for understanding the operation of TFTs and has been studied using ultraviolet photoelectronic spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. Instabilities of the operation of TFTs have been examined using time-dependent current-voltage measurements, charge modulated spectroscopies, and scanning probe methods. These methods have revealed the nature of charge carriers and trap states in semiconducting polymers.",2008,11/23/2012 0:34,11/23/2012 0:34,11/23/2012 0:34,445-457,,2,26,,,,,,,,,,,© 2008 American Vacuum Society,,,,Scitation,,,crystal microstructure; electrochemistry; electronic structure; organic semiconductors; photoelectron spectra; scanning probe microscopy; semiconductor thin films; thin film transistors; X-ray scattering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Harvesting their energy is consequently an important technological challenge. Here, we demonstrate direct excitonic energy transfer from ‘dark’ triplets in the organic semiconductor ?tetracene to colloidal ?PbS nanocrystals, thereby successfully harnessing molecular triplet excitons in the near infrared. Steady-state excitation spectra, supported by transient photoluminescence studies, demonstrate that the transfer efficiency is at least (90 ± 13)%. The mechanism is a Dexter hopping process consisting of the simultaneous exchange of two electrons. Triplet exciton transfer to nanocrystals is expected to be broadly applicable in solar and near-infrared light-emitting applications, where effective molecular phosphors are lacking at present.

However, plasmons propagating at the surface of a metal sustain propagation losses. A different type of surface excitation is the Dyakonov surface wave. These waves, which exist in lossless media, were predicted more than two decades ago but observed only recently. Dyakonov surface waves exist when at least one of the two media forming the surface exhibits a suitable anisotropy of refractive indexes. Although propagating only within a narrow range of directions, these waves can be used to create modes supported by ultrathin films that confine light efficiently within film thicknesses well below the cutoff thickness required in standard waveguides. Here, we show that 10 nm and 20 nm dielectric nanosheets of aluminium oxide clad between an anisotropic crystal (lithium triborate) and different liquids support Dyakonov-like modes. The direction of light propagation can be controlled by modulating the refractive index of the cladding. The possibility of guiding light in nanometre-thick films with no losses and high directionality makes Dyakonov wave modes attractive for planar photonic devices in schemes similar to those currently employing long-range plasmons.",25-May-14,5/26/2014 19:03,5/26/2014 19:03,5/26/2014 19:03,,,,advance online publication,,Nat Nano,,,,,,,,en,© 2014 Nature Publishing Group,,,,www.nature.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An oriented and periodic lamellar structure consisting of crystalline lamellae separated by amorphous interlamellar zones is evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both the overall crystallinity as well as the orientation of the crystalline lamellae decrease significantly with increasing Mw. The total lamellar periodicity is close to the length of “fully extended” chains for Mw = 7.3 kDa (polystyrene-equivalent molecular weight, eq. PS) and it saturates to a value of ca. (25–28) ± 2 nm for Mw ? 18.8 kDa (eq. PS). This behavior is attributed to a transition from an oligomeric-like system, for which P3HT chains are essentially in a fully extended all-trans conformation and do not fold, to a semicrystalline system that involves a periodic alternation of crystalline lamellae separated by extended amorphous interlamellar zones, which harbor chain folds, chain ends, and tie molecules. For P3HT with Mw of ca. 7.3 kDa (eq. PS), epitaxial crystallization on TCB allows for the growth of both “edge-on” and “flat-on” oriented crystalline lamellae on the TCB substrate. The orientation of the lamellae is attributed to 1D epitaxy. Because of the large size of the “flat-on” crystalline lamellae, a characteristic single-crystal electron diffraction pattern corresponding to the [001] zone was obtained by selected area electron diffraction (SAED), indicating that P3HT crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell with a = 16.0 Å, b = 7.8 Å, c = 7.8 Å, and ? = 93.5°.",2007,11/30/2012 22:31,11/30/2012 22:31,11/30/2012 22:31,101–108,,1,17,,,,,,,,,,en,"Copyright © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We establish that the essential signature of polaron absorption is the existence of three separate absorption peaks in the gap with qualitatively different features. For trans-(CH)x, we compare and contrast this structure with that from the kink solitons, which are expected to dominate the optical absorption at all but the lowest doping levels. For cis-(CH)x and related polymers, we discuss polaron (and multipolaron) absorption and the relation of polarons to possible excitons in these materials. Finally, we evaluate briefly the existing experimental situation regarding optical absorption in polyacetylene and indicate possible future experiments that could confirm the existence of polarons in (CH)x and similar polymers.",15-Apr-83,10/28/2012 20:55,10/28/2012 20:55,10/28/2012 20:55,4804-4825,,8,27,,Phys.

Spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements reveal a >50% increase in ZnPc signal, from which only 12% is accounted for by the increase in absorption associated with the face-on orientation.

Semi-metals, exemplified by bismuth, graphite and telluride alloys, have no energy bandgap and a very low density of states at the Fermi level. Furthermore, they typically have a higher Seebeck coefficient and lower thermal conductivities compared with metals, thus being suitable for thermoelectric applications. We measure the thermoelectric properties of various poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) samples, and observe a marked increase in the Seebeck coefficient when the electrical conductivity is enhanced through molecular organization. This initiates the transition from a Fermi glass to a semi-metal.

Here, we show that this challenge can be circumvented by using a metamaterial mirror whose reflection phase is tunable from that of a perfect electric mirror (? = ?) to that of a perfect magnetic mirror (? = 0). This tunability in reflection phase can also be exploited to optimize the standing wave profile in planar devices to maximize light–matter interaction. Specifically, we show that light absorption and photocurrent generation in a sub-100 nm active semiconductor layer of a model solar cell can be enhanced by ~20% over a broad spectral band.",Jul-14,7/24/2014 16:26,7/24/2014 16:26,7/24/2014 16:26,542-547,,7,9,,Nat Nano,,,,,,,,en,© 2014 Nature Publishing Group,,,,www.nature.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last 7 years, our group has employed transient absorption measurement to determine the relative quantum yields of long lived polaron pairs for over 300 different organic Donor / Acceptor blend films. We have shown that this optical assay of charge separation can be a strong indicator of photocurrent generation efficiency in complete devices. In this perspective we consider the lessons which can be drawn from these studies concerning the parameters which determine efficiency of this photo-induced charge separation in such solar cells. We consistently find, from studies of several materials series, that the energy offset driving charge separation is a key determinant of the efficiency of this charge generation, and thereby photocurrent generation. Moreover, we find that the magnitude of the energy offset required to drive charge separation, and the strength of this energetic dependence, varies substantially between materials classes. In particular, Donor / Acceptor co-polymers are found to be capable of driving charge separation in blends with PCBM at much lower energy offsets than thiophene based polymers, whilst replacement of PCBM with more crystalline perylene diimide acceptors is also observed to reduce the energy offset requirement for charge separation. We go on to discuss the role of film microstructure in also determining the efficiency of charge separation, including the role of mixed and pure domains, PCBM exciton diffusion limitations and the role of material crystallinity in modulating material energetics, thereby providing additional energy offsets which can stabilise the spatial separation of charges. Other factors considered include the role of coulombically bound polaron pair or charge transfer states, device electric fields, charge carrier mobilities, triplet excitons and photon energy. We discuss briefly a model for charge separation consistent with these and other observations. We conclude by summarising the materials design guidelines for efficient charge photogeneration which can be drawn from these studies.",9-Sep-13,9/30/2013 21:46,9/30/2013 21:46,9/30/2013 21:46,,,,,,Chem.

GIXD measurements confirm extended in-plane lamellae ordering and out-of-plane ??? stacking. Angle-resolved surface-sensitive NEXAFS measurements, however, indicate a lack of preferred in-plane or out-of-plane orientation of either the conjugated backbone or side chains at the P(NDI2OD-T2) film surface. This lack of pronounced orientation effects is attributed to a significant proportion of amorphous content in the film, with NEXAFS measurements sensitive to both amorphous and crystalline content while GIXD is sensitive only to coherent ordering. Furthermore, it is found that increased crystallinity in annealed thin films is not beneficial to the performance of top-gate bottom-contact field-effect transistors. In fact, both highly crystalline and amorphous P(NDI2OD-T2) devices exhibit similar device performance with saturation mobilities around 0.04 and 0.02 cm2/(V s), respectively, almost 1 order of magnitude lower than the high-performance devices where the pristine morphology has not been subjected to significant heat treatment.

A variety of X-ray diffraction analyses, including pole figure construction and Fourier transform peak shape deconvolution, are employed to quantify the texture change, relative degree of crystallinity and lattice order. We find that annealing the polymer film to the melt leads to a shift from 77.5% face-on to 94.6% edge-on lamellar texture as well as to a 2-fold increase in crystallinity and a 40% decrease in intracrystallite cumulative disorder. The texture change results in a significant drop in the electron-only diode current density through the film thickness upon melt annealing while little change is observed in the in-plane transport of bottom gated thin film transistors.

In particular a novel approach is used whereby the bulk molecular orientation and surface molecular orientation are simultaneously measured on the same sample using NEXAFS spectroscopy in an angle-resolved transmission experiment. Furthermore, the acquisition of bulk-sensitive NEXAFS data enables a direct comparison of the information provided by GIWAXS and NEXAFS. By comparison of the bulk-sensitive and surface-sensitive NEXAFS data, a distinctly different molecular orientation is observed at the surface of the film compared to the bulk. While a more ?face-on? orientation of the conjugated backbone is observed in the bulk of the film, consistent with the lamella orientation observed by GIWAXS, a more ?edge-on? orientation is observed at the surface of the film with surface-sensitive NEXAFS spectroscopy. This distinct edge-on surface orientation explains the high in-plane mobility that is achieved in top-gate P(NDI2OD-T2) field-effect transistors (FETs), while the bulk face-on texture explains the high out-of-plane mobilities that are observed in time-of-flight and diode measurements.

In these disordered systems both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters play significant roles. In general, ?-electron delocalization, interchain interaction, band gap, carrier density, extent of disorder, morphology and processing of materials determine the electrical and optical properties. The chemical structure, especially the role of side groups, is quite important in both physical and processing properties. The nature of charge carriers and their role in charge transport depend on the structure and morphology of the system. Hence in several semiconducting polymer devices, the correlations among structure, morphology and transport are rather strong. The dependence of carrier mobility on temperature and electric field needs to be understood in the framework of competing models based on carrier hopping, trapping/detrapping and tunneling. Exactly what determines the dispersive/nondispersive, polaronic and correlative transport regimes is yet to be quantified. An understanding of the carrier mobility in semiconducting polymers is necessary to optimize the performance of polymeric electronic devices.

GIXD measurements confirm extended in-plane lamellae ordering and out-of-plane pi-pi stacking. Angle-resolved surface-sensitive NEXAFS measurements, however, indicate a lack of preferred in-plane or out-of-plane orientation of either the conjugated backbone or side chains at the P(NDI2OD-T2) film surface. This lack of pronounced orientation effects is attributed to a significant proportion of amorphous content in the film, with NEXAFS measurements sensitive to both amorphous and crystalline content while GIXD is sensitive only to coherent ordering. Furthermore, it is found that increased crystallinity in annealed thin films is not beneficial to the performance of top-gate bottom-contact field-effect transistors. In fact, both highly crystalline and amorphous P(NDI2OD-T2) devices exhibit similar device performance with saturation mobilities around 0.04 and 0.02 cm(2)/(V s), respectively, almost I order of magnitude lower than the high-performance devices where the pristine morphology has not been subjected to significant heat treatment.

They mediate the conversion of injected charges – electrons and holes – into photons. Phosphorescent emission originating from triplet excitons is especially important, as it is to date the only general route to enable unity charge-to-photon conversion efficiencies. In this paper, we discuss the key aspects of excitons, following the excited state lifecycle. First, we review fundamentals of singlet and triplet exciton formation in organic semiconductors, followed by a discussion of concepts that aim to alter the singlet-to-triplet formation rates to enable higher electroluminescence yields in the fluorescence manifold. Subsequently, we focus on the exciton distribution within the organic semiconductor material during its lifetime. The processes involved ultimately determine organic light-emitting diode (OLED) performance and are especially key in the development of concepts for white emission, where precise balance of the exciton between different emitter species control the emitted color. We close this paper with discussion of non-linear effects at high excitation levels that, to date, limit the high brightness efficiency of phosphorescent OLEDs.",2012,8/29/2013 23:17,8/29/2013 23:17,8/29/2013 23:17,2341–2353,,12,209,,,,,,,,,,en,"Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this paper, we show that optical anisotropies in a canonical OPV material, P3HT, strongly affect absorption enhancements in ultra-thin textured OPV cells. In particular we show that plasmonic and gap-mode solar cell architectures redistribute electromagnetic energy into the out-of-plane field component, independent of the active layer orientation.

In contrast, the photogenerated excitons in organic photovoltaic cells are dissociated at a single donor–acceptor heterojunction formed within a de-mixed blend of the donor and acceptor semiconductors. The nanoscale morphology and high charge densities give a high rate of electron–hole encounters, which should in principle result in the formation of spin-triplet excitons, as in organic light-emitting diodes. Although organic photovoltaic cells would have poor quantum efficiencies if every encounter led to recombination, state-of-the-art examples nevertheless demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency. Here we show that this suppression of recombination arises through the interplay between spin, energetics and delocalization of electronic excitations in organic semiconductors. We use time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of model high-efficiency polymer–fullerene systems in which the lowest-energy molecular triplet exciton (T1) for the polymer is lower in energy than the intermolecular charge transfer state. We observe the formation of T1 states following bimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes generate charge transfer states with both spin-singlet (1CT) and spin-triplet (3CT) characters. We show that the formation of triplet excitons can be the main loss mechanism in organic photovoltaic cells. But we also find that, even when energetically favoured, the relaxation of 3CT states to T1 states can be strongly suppressed by wavefunction delocalization, allowing for the dissociation of 3CT states back to free charges, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance. Our results point towards new design rules both for photoconversion systems, enabling the suppression of electron–hole recombination, and for organic light-emitting diodes, avoiding the formation of triplet excitons and enhancing fluorescence efficiency.",22-Aug-13,8/23/2013 23:09,8/23/2013 23:09,8/23/2013 23:09,435-439,,7463,500,,Nature,,,,,,,,en,"© 2013 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

According to this theoretical model, the magnetic field modulation of anthracene hot singlet fission is the reverse of the modulation of triplet fusion. Accurate observations of fission, however, have shown there are some consistent differences, and these differences are discussed in terms of the fission process.",15-Aug-77,12/11/2012 18:19,12/11/2012 18:19,12/11/2012 18:19,1685-1693,,4,16,,Phys.

Cells made with a single polymer and two electrodes tend to be inefficient because the photogenerated excitons are usually not split by the built-in electric field, which arises from differences in the electrode work functions. The efficiency can be increased by splitting the excitons at an interface between two semiconductors with offset energy levels. Power conversion efficiencies of almost 4% have been achieved by blending polymers with electron-accepting materials such as C60 derivatives, cadmium selenide, and titanium dioxide. We predict that efficiencies higher than 10% can be achieved by optimizing the cell's architecture to promote efficient exciton splitting and charge transport and by reducing the band gap of the polymer so that a larger fraction of the solar spectrum can be absorbed.",1-Nov-04,11/27/2012 6:53,11/27/2012 6:53,11/27/2012 6:53,4533-4542,,23,16,,Chem.

Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials.",4-Aug-13,8/5/2013 22:30,8/5/2013 22:30,8/5/2013 22:30,,,,advance online publication,,Nat Mater,,,,,,,,en,© 2013 Nature Publishing Group,,,,www.nature.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class of matter—topologically ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder. Current research into engineering topological order primarily focuses on analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields for photons at room temperature, using linear silicon photonics. We observe, for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two-dimensional system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize topological order in both non-interacting and many-body regimes.",Dec-13,12/3/2013 23:53,12/3/2013 23:53,12/3/2013 23:53,1001-1005,,12,7,,Nat Photon,,,,,,,,en,© 2013 Nature Publishing Group,,,,www.nature.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
